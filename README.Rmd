# AutoSpectral

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

AutoSpectral is AutoSpill updated for the spectral flow era.

It is also pretty complex and newly released, so there will be bugs. Sorry. Please read the [help pages and articles](https://drcytometer.github.io/AutoSpectral/) before submitting bug reports. There's a lot of info there.

The goal of AutoSpectral is to provide you with the best possible spectral 
signatures of the fluorophores in your single-stained controls. Whether or not
these accurately model your fully stained samples will depend on what you've 
chosen to use for the controls, how they were prepared and other factors such
as machine condition and any divergence in handling between samples and controls. 

More to the point, AutoSpectral is intended to make working with messy cell-based
controls as easy as compensation beads. This should give you better accuracy
and precision in your spectral definition and thus in your unmixing.

Plus, you can extract each cell's individual autofluorescent background in a 
manner specific to that cell, producing better unmixing with less spread.

At the moment, the following cytometers are supported:

* Cytek Aurora/Northern Lights ("aurora")
* Sony ID7000 ("id7000")
* BD FACSDiscoverS8 ("s8")
* BD FACSDiscoverA8 ("a8")
* Agilent NovoCyte Opteon ("opteon")

There will likely be some unresolved issues with plotting data from certain 
configurations of the ID7000 and Aurora. Please note that FCS 3.2 files from the
S8 and A8 cytometers are not fully supported in flowCore. You may receive 
warnings, but things should still work.

If you want to use data from another cytometer and are wiling to provide files 
for establishing the workflow, contact the author/maintainer.

This work has received funding from the KU Leuven C1 program, the European Union’s 
Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 874707 
(EXIMIOUS), Wellcome Investigator Award, 222442/A/21/Z and UKRI Proactive 
Vaccinology Award, MR/Y004450/1 (IMMPROVE).

## Installation

You can install the development version of AutoSpectral from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}

# Optional: Install Bioconductor packages
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(c("flowWorkspace", "flowCore", "PeacoQC", "Biobase"))

# You'll need devtools or remotes to install from GitHub.
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("DrCytometer/AutoSpectral")
```

## Example

This is a basic example of the workflow, using samples from the ID7000:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library( AutoSpectral )

# Define the location of the single-stained control files.
control.dir <- "./Cell controls"

# Get the parameters for your cytometer.
# Supported cytometers include "aurora", "id7000", "a8", "s8" and "opteon".
asp <- get.autospectral.param( cytometer = "id7000", figures = TRUE )

# Optionally, create a control file (see article on this).
# After creating it, manually edit to ensure it is correct.
create.control.file( control.dir, asp )

# Locate the edited control file.
control.def.file <- "fcs_control_file.csv"

# check the control file for errors
control.file.errors <- check.control.file( control.dir, control.def.file, asp )

## Adjustments to automated gating
# This will be covered more extensively elsewhere.
# in this case, the cells on scatter are very small, so we modify the target.
asp$gate.bound.density.max.target.cells <- 0

# Load the control files, gate, prepare for spectral extraction.
# This is usually the slowest step.
flow.control <- define.flow.control( control.dir, control.def.file, asp )

# For speed and accuracy, the recommended approach is to clean the controls
# using separate (universal) negative samples for both beads and cells.
# In doing so, we select cells with matching autofluorescent background and
# restrict the calculations to the brightest events.
flow.control <- clean.controls( flow.control, asp )

# Extract the clean spectra
univ.neg.spectra <- get.fluorophore.spectra( flow.control, asp,  
                                             use.clean.expr = TRUE,
                              title = "Universal Negative Cells" )

# By default AutoSpectral extracts autofluorescence as a spectrum.
# This is comparable to "Autofluorescence as a Fluorescent Tag" in SpectroFlo
# More on this later.
# To remove this AF parameter for unmixing:
no.af.spectra <- univ.neg.spectra[ ! rownames( univ.neg.spectra ) == "AF", ]

## Unmixing
# Set the location of the raw files to be unmixed.
sample.dir <- "./Raw samples"

# Perform unmixing, here we will unmix all fcs files in the folder using 
# Weighted least squares (WLS or in Sony lingo, WLSM).
unmix.folder( sample.dir, no.af.spectra, asp, flow.control, method = "WLS" )


```


## Go Faster

R is not known for its speed.

For faster processing there are three things you can do, hopefully all fairly
easy. 

First, upgrade the BLAS and LAPACK libraries used by R. These
provide algorithms for linear algebra, which is the heart of spectral unmixing.
Simply swapping out your .dll files as in this tutorial can give speed ups of 5x.
[Install OpenBLAS](https://github.com/david-cortes/R-openblas-in-windows)
All this involves is downloading the files from the internet, placing them in 
the right folder and doing a quick restart.

Do not set multiple threads for the BLAS as this will conflict with higher
level parallelization, either in AutoSpectral or other packages.

[More on fast BLAS](https://csantill.github.io/RPerformanceWBLAS/)

Second, install AutoSpectralRcpp. This is fully accessible from R and integrates
with AutoSpectral. But, when it gets to the slow bits in the unmixing, it 
switches over to calculating in C++, so it can be 10-100x faster.

[AutoSpectralRcpp](https://github.com/DrCytometer/AutoSpectralRcpp)

You can install the development version of AutoSpectralRcpp like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("DrCytometer/AutoSpectralRcpp")
```
Third, turn on parallel processing in AutoSpectral and AutoSpectralRcpp. At the
moment, this is not fully optimized in AutoSpectral. The parallel processing in 
AutoSpectralRcpp operates via OpenMP and works well.

To activate parallel processing, either set the `parallel` flag to `TRUE` in
`asp` or check the function arguments for a `parallel` option. Sorry, this will
be cleaned up soon.

``` r
asp$parallel <- TRUE
```

For unmixing larger data sets, you will do well to use a machine with more CPUs.
Suggestions for faster processing are welcome. Some modest improvements are in 
the works.
